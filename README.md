# ESP8266 ePaperDisplay<br>
## This project will bring life into ePaper displays and IoT applications.<br>
### This project is made under the term of my university research.
I'm going to use the 1.54 inch ePaper display from waveshare and it is driven by an ESP8266 based NodeMCU v3.<br>
I'm using the NonOS SDK from Espressif.<br>
